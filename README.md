This is a simple *rule-based chatbot* built using Python.  
It uses basic if-else conditions to respond to user input with predefined answers.

The chatbot can:
- Greet the user
- Introduce itself
- Respond to simple queries
- Exit when the user types bye
- *Keyword Matching*: Detects specific words like "hello", "how are you", "help".
- *Loop Interaction*: Keeps chatting until the user types bye.
- *Case Insensitive*: Works regardless of input case (Hello, HELLO, hello are the same).
- Python 3.x (No external libraries needed)
1. Save the chatbot code in a file, e.g., chatbot.py.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
  

Chatbot: Hi! I am a simple chatbot. Type 'bye' to exit.
You: hello
Chatbot: Hello! How can I help you?
You: how are you
Chatbot: I'm just a program, but I'm doing great! Thanks for asking.
You: your name
Chatbot: Iâ€™m ChatBot 1.0, your friendly assistant.
You: bye
Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a nice day.
ðŸ“– How It Works
User input is taken with input().
The text is converted to lowercase to avoid case mismatches.
The chatbot checks for specific keywords using if-elif-else.
If no match is found, it gives a default "didnâ€™t understand" message.
Typing bye ends the conversation.
Add more responses and rules.
Use regular expressions for smarter matching.
Extend with NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy for better understanding.
